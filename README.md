# BarcodeVisionApiExample
Trying play services vision api for barcode

This is an example of using the Vision API to read barcodes

Currently, the app just reads the barcode value and outputs in the log

Known issue : For some devices that dont support auto focus,(tested on s3 mini on 4.2.2), couldnt find a way to fix it.

WIP : To get the rectangle showing in the scanner and pass that information back to the main activity
